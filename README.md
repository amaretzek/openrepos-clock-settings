Jolla Clock Settings
====================

![icon](openrepos-clock-settings.png)

Settings page for the Sailfish OS clock, which allows you to change volume
and snooze interval for the clock alarm. The default interval (5 min) was
too short for me. Some people don't like the default alarm volume.

Doesn't affect calendar alarms.

Builds are available from [OpenRepos.net](https://openrepos.net/content/slava/clock-settings).
